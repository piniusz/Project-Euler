A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Python solution:

def palindromic_check(number):
    reverse = str()
    for i in str(number):
        reverse = i + reverse

    if reverse == str(number):
        return True
    return False

palidromic_num = []

for i in range(100,1000):
    for n in range(100,1000):
        test = palindromic_check(i*n)
        if test == True:
            palidromic_num.append(i*n)

max_pali = max(palidromic_num)
